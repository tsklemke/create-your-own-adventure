You continue to listen and the voice gets louder and louder

and louder still.

Soon you can't think of anything else and you're trapped.

The next thing you know you're laying on the floor.

You woozily walk to your bathroom to wash your face.

As you look into the mirror you're startled to see that your hair has turned...

completely WHITE!
